my site is made up of a lot of pages, i need to take inventory of the pages i have/need to determine if i can use Hugo to replace them.

## Ideal Homepage
notes from [The website architect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0db5kA4BfQ)
- Its not a powerpoint presentation (avoid fancy, unnecessary, slideshow style scrolling)
- don't use sliders (if its important enough to put on your homepage, why hide it behind a slider)
- homepage doesn't have any useful info

Above the fold, answer 3 questions:
- Who are you?
- What do you do?
- How can you help me?

you should also have a customer journey, where are you funneling visitors?
1. Who you are, what you do
2. How great you are and why they should consider you
3. **Call to action**

Play to expectations
1. Logo - Top left
2. Nav bar - Top
3. Scroll for more info
4. Footer

## Pages
list of potential pages:
- Home
- About - short little bio
- Skills - Eg. Git, Linux, Rust, Small engines, Laptop repair, Watch making, etc
- Experiences - Work history like ace hardware, Foss swim school, etc.
- Education - avoid since this section might be empty other than attempts?
- Accomplishments - eg. certifications
- Achievements - eg. ran a 5K
- Projects - My cozy game, my painting, DIY Watch, etc.
- News - Show my "News-worthy" things like Keiki's Dream etc
- Blog - 
- Notes - 
- Gist - 
- Links - Easy, just use the [Lynx Theme for Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/lynx/) 

### Homepage
mainly just need a picture, short bio, and 1 or 2 call to action buttons. pretty simple.
**Difficulty: 2/5**

*Features:*
- picture
- short bio
- 1 or 2 call to action buttons



### Portfolio
this is basically the same as a blog section but might want interactive examples?
**Difficulty: 2/5**

*Features:*
- **A List of each of my projects** 1/5 Difficulty. Make a MD file for each project, use a range to list each one.
- **Interactive project pages?** 5/5 Difficulty. not sure how i would do it.

### Blog

*Features:*
- **A list of each of my blog posts** 1/5 Difficulty. Make a MD file for each blog post, use a range to list each one.

### Shop
this will likely be the hardest thing to recreate as a Hugo site since its dynamic info and needs a payment system. might even be worth it to host the store on a woo-commerce site.

### About

*Features:*
- **Single page?**
- **List of skills**
- **List of projects**

### Contact

- **Contact Request Form** 3/5 Difficulty. one idea is to embed a google form into the page, it doesnt seem too hard to do.
