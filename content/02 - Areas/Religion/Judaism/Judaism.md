## Shabbat
The day of rest that starts at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday. Most of the time when we refer to Shabbat we mean Friday night, especially dinner. There are many ways to “keep Shabbat.” Most refer to a staying away from using any electricity, perhaps going to synagogue, taking a nap, spending time with family and friends and recharging yourself for the workweek ahead.

The point of Shabbat is to rest. Stay away from hectic places or If you want you can follow stricter rules, like not driving, carrying money, emailing or watching TV. Going to a synagogue (Friday is higher energy and shorter, Saturday is like 2 hours)
