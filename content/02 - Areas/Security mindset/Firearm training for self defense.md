### Clearing Failures
Failures of a firearm are bound to happen, knowing how to clear the failure is very important.

#### Click, no bang
You pull the trigger but no bang and just hear a click. What happened?!

**Causes**:
1. Didn't Pull slide back all the way
2. Pulling slide before or while inserting the clip
3. Bad primer
4. Other issues with cartridge/bullet

**Solution**: slap clip and rack the slide

#### No click, "out of battery"
You pull the trigger but for some reason nothing happens. What is going on?!

**Causes**:
1. Didn't Pull slide back all the way
2. Pulling slide before or while inserting the clip
3. Don't guide the slide forward, let the spring do its job

**Solution**: tap the slide forward.

#### Stove-pipe
You pull the trigger, it goes bang, but the bullet casing gets stuck coming out of the slide. It kinda looks like a stove pipe, thus the name.

**Causes**:
1. 

**Solution**: either karate chop the stove pipe towards the end of the barrel of the gun OR tap the mag and rack the slide(this wastes the next bullet)
