## Notes: 
- training reduced accidents by 70%
- most fatalities are from tip overs. 
- there's 7 "classes" of forklifts
- narrow aisle Orderpickers(class II) REQUIRE fall protection harness
- Class 4 and 5 are similar but class 4 is cushion tires, 5 is air tire
- air foam or solid rubber filled pneumatic tires for "improved surfaces"
- IC = internal combustion (gas, diesel, propane)
- class 7 has an unmanned boom forks.
- overhead guard protects operator from falling objects
- forklift batteries exhaust hydrogen gas
- maximum withdrawal valve cuts off LPG if a line gets cut or something
- 25 ft or out of site is not in control

### 7 Classes of forklifts:
- Class I: Electric motor rider trucks
- Class II: Electric motor narrow aisle trucks
- Class III: Electric motor hand trucks or hand/rider trucks
- Class IV: Internal combustion engine trucks (solid/cushion tires)
- Class V: Internal combustion engine trucks (pneumatic tires)
- Class VI: Electric and internal combustion engine tractors
- Class VII: Rough terrain forklift trucks

### Power Labels:
- E: Electric
- D: Diesel
- G: Gasoline
- LP: Liquid Petroleum Gas
- C: Compressed Natural Gas
- L: Liquid Natural Gas
- H: Hydrogen

#### Power labels expanded:
- EE: Electric trucks that have additional safeguards to the electrical system to prevent emission of hazardous sparks and limit surface temperatures
- ES: Electric trucks that are provided with electrical and other safeguards to the power source and exposed electrical equipment
- EX: Electric trucks that differ from E, EE, and ES trucks in that the electrical fittings and equipment are designed, constructed, and assembled to be used in atmospheres containing flammable gases or vapors
- DS: Diesel trucks that are provided with additional safeguards to the exhaust, fuel, and electrical systems
- DY: Diesel trucks that have all the requirements of DS trucks and in addition do not have any electrical equipment, including the ignition, and are equipped with temperature limitation features
- GS: Gasoline trucks that are provided with additional safeguards to the exhaust, fuel, and electrical systems
- LP: Liquid Petroleum Gas trucks that are provided with additional safeguards to the exhaust, fuel, and electrical systems
- LPS: LP trucks that are provided with additional safeguards to the exhaust, fuel, and electrical systems and do not have any electrical equipment, including the ignition, and are equipped with temperature limitation features
