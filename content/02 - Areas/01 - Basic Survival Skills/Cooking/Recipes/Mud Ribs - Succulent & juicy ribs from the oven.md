# Mud Ribs recipe  
This is a recipe i created for ribs that happen to be the best ribs i have ever had. The recipe gets its name for how the ribs are wet and so packed with seasonings before cooking that it looks like they have been dragged through the mud.
  
## Recipe  
Very simple recipe, feel free to modify the seasonings as desired! Basically just cut up the ribs, coat them in mustard, pack on the seasonings, and cook.
  
### Dry ingredients  
- Dark brown sugar
- Chili powder
- Paprika
- Ground back pepper
- Garlic salt
- onion powder
- Italian seasonings
  
### Wet ingredients  
- Mustard
- BBQ Sauce (I recommend Sweet baby rays)
  
### Instructions  
1. Mix the Dry ingedients with the Dark brown sugar, set aside.
2. Cut each rib so they are all separate.
3. Coat the ribs in mustard, rubbing into each rib. (Alternatively toss in a large bowl)
4. Coat the ribs in the seasoning mix
5. lay the ribs flat in a baking tray (Dont stack the ribs or use a baking sheet, it WILL leak out)
