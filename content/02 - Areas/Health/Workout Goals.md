## Terms
- **Banded**: the use of an elastic band to increase the resistance
- **abduct**: (of a muscle) move (a limb or part) away from the midline of the body or from another part
- **Clam-shells**: laying on your side positioned like you are in a chair, and raising and lowering your upper leg (resembles a clams movement)
- **Fire-Hydrant**: on your hands and knees, abduct your leg to the side by 90 degrees and then lower it back down.
- **Fire-Hydrant & Kick**: Same as the Fire-Hydrants but adding a kicking motion when at the height of the movement
- **Supermans**: laying on your stomach with your arms and legs outstretched like superman flying, lift your arms and legs upwards and then back down.
- **Flutter-Kicks**: laying on your back stretch out your legs and kick them as though swimming on your back
- **Reverse Flutter-Kicks**: the same as the regular flutter kicks but laying face down this time.
