Description:In this episode, the viewer will identify the virtual private network \(VPN\) communications as well as the benefits of implementing VPNs. The viewer will also compare and contrast different types of VPN implementations such as remote-access, site-to-site, Always-on, split vs. full tunneling and tunneling protocols such as  point-to-point tunneling \(PPTP\) and layer 2 tunneling protocol \(L2TP\).
