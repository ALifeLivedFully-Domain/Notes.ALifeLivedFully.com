Topic: Operational Security and Incident Response  
Episode: Pentesting Exercise Types  
Learner Objectives:  
  

*Identify the techniques used in penetration testing*

Description:In this episode, the viewer will identify the techniques used in penetration exercise types commonly known and red, blue, purple and white team exercises.

-------

* Exercise types
	- Red-team
		+ Offensive Security
		+ Testing defense mechanism and resiliency to external attacks
		+ Test/improves the capabilities of the defense mechanisms
		+ Identify and exploit vulnerabilities
		+ Physical, hardware, software and human vulnerabilities
		+ Help address and fix identified security vulnerabilities
		+ Typically not part of the company
		+ Skill examples
			- computer systems and protocols
			- software development skills
			- penetration testing
			- Communication interception
			- Social engineering skills
			- Attack frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK)
	- Blue-team
		+ Defensive security
		+ Identify potential vulnerabilities
		+ But instead of exploiting the vulnerabilities, they seek to avoid, deter, resist an respond to threats
		+ Think of it a monitoring, detection and reaction \(what countermeasure need to be in place or upgrade, reconfigured\)
		+ Detect block mitigate
		+ Usually part of the company
		+ IDS, IPS, packet analysis, log/packet aggregation
		+ EDR \(endpoint detection and response\)
		+ Honey-pots
		+ Skill examples
			- Security strategy
			- Analysis skills
			- Hardening techniques
			- System detection tools
	- Red-team/blue-team discussions
		+ Red-team discusses the attack methods used, actions take
		+ Blue-team can use this information to evalute and prioritize changes to prevent another similiar attack from being successful.
		+ Lack of sharing information of attack techniques and tools gave rise to the "purple team"
	- Purple-team
		+ Red and blue teams working in unison
		+ Both teams fully debrief each other
		+ Both teams sharing information like
			- Attack techniques
			- Attack tools
			- Finding and outcomes
	- White-team
		+ Responsible for refereeing the red team/blue team engagement
		+ Observes the excerise
		+ Scores the exercise
		+ Resolve disputes between the red/blue team
		+ The judges of that enforce the RoE
		+ Derive the lessons-learned
		+ Accurate post-exercise/engagement assessment
