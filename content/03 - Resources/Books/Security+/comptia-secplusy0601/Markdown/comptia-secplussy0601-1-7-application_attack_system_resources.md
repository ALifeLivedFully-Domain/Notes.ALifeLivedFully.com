Topic: Threats, Attacks and Vulnerabilities  
Episode: Application Attacks - System Resources 
Learner Objectives:  
*Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks.*  
Description: In this episode, the viewer will identify application attacks that can cause system resource issues such as resource exhaustion, memory leaks, driver manipulation, integer overflows, race conditions and pointer deferencing.

---------

* Resources and Memory
	+ Resource Exhaustion
	+ Memory Leak
* Dan tee up demo \(So if we think there is resource exhaustion, what would we see?)
* Driver Manipulation
	+ Shimming
	+ Refactoring
* Integer Overflow
* Race Condition
	+ Processes could be trying to access the same resource \(think to the old days of IRQs)
	+ Show System Information and IRQs \(What happens to two processes trying to use the same IRQ?)
* Demo - Show System Information \(IRQs and memory assignments)
* TOC/TOU
* Pointer/object dereference
