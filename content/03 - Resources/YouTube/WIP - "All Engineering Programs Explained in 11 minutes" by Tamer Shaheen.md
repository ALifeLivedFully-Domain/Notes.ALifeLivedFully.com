# "All Engineering Programs Explained in 11 minutes" by Tamer Shaheen
trying to figure out how bad i want to study engineering

## Engineering Disciplines
- Mechanical
- Electrical
- Software
- Chemical
- Civil
- Mechatronics engineering
- industrial

## Personal Notes
- So far im thinking mechanical engineer and self study software engineering since its less degree focused.
- mechanical engineer sounds interesting but i feel like it wouldnt be involving electrical engineering concepts.
- Software engineer seems like a waste of an engineering degree since its not required and the info is easily obtained
- I have heard of mechatronics engineering before and it sounds awesome to combine all these disciplines together
