## Notes
- all about thinking for yourself
- believes that hierarchical government is inherently violent and competitive
- humans naturally cooperative rather than naturally violent or competitive.
- after natural disasters governments practically disappear, whilst people self organize to fulfill the needs of their community
- humans have self organized communities far longer than hierarchical government has existed.
- All property represents the labor of many, claimed by a single owner.

### Classical Anarchism and how it relates to Communism
they are both similar in that they both believe that economic exploitation hinders freedom, however where they differ is that most communists believe that we can create a government that protects its people from this exploitation by giving the power to the workers while anarchists believe its impossible to have any form of centralizing power without economic exploitation.

I wouldn't word it that way, I would say that any centralizing of power will lead to the exploitation or disenfranchisement of one or more groups of people unjustly. 

For example Communism + Slavery -OR- Communism + Sexism obviously doesn't result in a fair and just society. A society where we are all equal and there is no hierarchy will inherently be a fair and just society.

### Collectivist Anarchism
