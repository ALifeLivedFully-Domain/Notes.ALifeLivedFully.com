# "All Engineering Programs Explained in 11 minutes" by Tamer Shaheen
trying to figure out how bad i want to study engineering and which engineering program i sould focus on.

>[!tldr]
>Im mainly interested in:
>1. Mechatronics
>2. Electrical
>3. Mechanical
>4. Software. 
>5. **Bio-Technical Engineering!**
>   
>   I'm also very interested in chemical engineering but i have never taken much if any chemistry classes so its hard to know if i could major in it.

## Engineering Disciplines
- Mechanical
- Electrical
- Software
- Chemical
- Civil
- Mechatronics engineering
- industrial

## Personal Notes
- So far im thinking mechanical engineer and just self study software engineering later since its less degree focused?
- mechanical engineer sounds interesting but i feel like it wouldn't be involving electrical engineering concepts.
- Software engineer seems like a waste of an engineering degree sometimes since its not required and the info is easily obtained online
- I have heard of mechatronics engineering before and it sounds awesome to combine all these disciplines together
