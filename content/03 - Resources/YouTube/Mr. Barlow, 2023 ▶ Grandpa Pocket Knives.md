# Mr. Barlow, 2023 â–¶ Grandpa Pocket Knives
A look at one mans collection of old school classic style knives.


>[!tldr]
>I liked the [[#Camillus GI Scout Knife]] the best, either that or a leatherman might be a good daily carry knife to pickup. *(I'm also still on the lookout for a classic style knife with at least 1 locking blade)*
