i like some of these ideas 

- **References** direct quotes you get from highlighting a book or a youtube clip etc. 
	- **Medium** book, article, video, podcast, tweet, etc
	- **Source** name of the book, movie, etc
	- **Author** Author of the source
	- **Quote** direct quotes that you are interested in.
- **Literature notes** your own musings on the quote. what did you get from of it?
	- **Link to references** link to the direct quote you are thinking about
	- **Key takeaways** 
- **Permanent notes** 
	- **Atomic notes** 1 note should only hold 1 idea
	- **Short and concise** less than 1 page of writing
	- **Easy to understand** anyone with a basic knowledge of the topic should be able to read and understand the note
	- **1+ links** 
- **Published work** published work is based off of multiple permanent notes
	- **Medium** it can be anything book, article, blog post, video, or even an assignment for a class perhaps?
	- **Links** link to multiple permanent notes and use them to help you write this published work
	- **Kanban** i would like to use a kanban board to track the progress of each of these pieces of work


something cool about this is that if i actually use this system you can track my thought process from start to finish and if i make my notes public i can show my process, show my work, etc which seems handy especially in the age of AI

```math-plain
current_age = 26
current_year = 2024
birth_year = 1998
elec_app = 5
current_age + elec_app
current_year + elec_app
```
