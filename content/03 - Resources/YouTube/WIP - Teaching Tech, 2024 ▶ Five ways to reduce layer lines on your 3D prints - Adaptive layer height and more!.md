# Teaching Tech, 2024 ▶ Five ways to reduce layer lines on your 3D prints - Adaptive layer height and more!
learn techniques to get smooth layer lines.

>[!tldr]
>1. Certain color filament makes it harder to see layer lines.
>2. Use variable layer height and when it makes sense, turn on fuzzy skin. 
>3. Post-Processing will allow you to make the biggest change, but requires the most work.

## Notes
The five suggestions are as follows:

### Post-Print Processing
fill the gaps with Bondo, Epoxy, or Woodfiller and then sand it down and maybe even polish it.

you can also use vapor smoothing to chemically smooth out the surface with a solvant like acetone.

it works but i am mainly focused on changing my techniques and slicer settings.

### Filiment Color Matters
seeing the layer lines relies on the contrasting color of the layers of plastic and the shadows, choosing the right color, texture, pattern or effect can reduce the visibility of the lines.

### Fuzzy-Skin


### Variable layer height


### Combine techniques for best results
