# "How to survive in war" by CivDiv
War is rough, I have never been in war but one day I might be whether I like it or not. better to be prepared than not prepared.

>[!tldr]
>1. utilize small recon teams before an assault

>3. Discipline

## Primary points
1. utilize small recon teams before an assault
	1. wont trigger strong response
	2. wont trigger build up of forces expecting a large attack
2. basic training & cross training (can be learned in 2-3 months)
	1. know the weapons systems and how they work
	2. know the mission before going on it to maintain momentum
	3. dispersion - don't clump up, avoid mass casualty events
	4. camouflage 
	5. Go Prone - make yourself a smaller target
	6. communication
3. NCO Corps
	1. complacency is the biggest threat
	2. discipline to follow the basic training

## Notes
- 90% luck üçÄ
- Faraday bags as a dump pouch
- Medical supplies & training to use them (You WILL get hit eventually)
- changing patrol rountes often if possible
- avoid TRPs target reference points
	- much quicker to say bomb that intersection vs bomb these gps points
- good camo is crucial
- avoid detection by drones
- Crosstrain! everyone should learn how to do each role

### Small arms
- wear a plate carrier if possible
	- face the enemy while firing
- GO PRONE - make yourself a smaller target
- always be looking for cover
	- even micro terrain like divots in the ground can make a difference
- suppression
	- RTR = return fire, take cover, return accurate fire
### Explosives
- soft armor under plate armor helps 
- pelvic armor 
	- pelvis bones
	- main arteries
- Kevlar helmets
	- not for rifle rounds
	- good for shrapnel
- dispersion prevents mass casualty events
- GO PRONE - many explosives explode upwards
- go underground
	- basements
	- trenches
	- dugouts
	- etc
### Sound indications
- incoming vs outgoing 
- much of this has to be learned in the battlefield unfortunately
### Drones
- plate Armor
- blanket door for bunker or even wire mesh
- jamming guns and backbacks
- work with Large jammer
- go underground
- avoid detection
- shotguns/drone guards
	- if a drone is heard, everyone goes prone and the drone guard in camo responds with a shotgun
### Mines
- mine clearing vehicles & equipment
- Ranger file
	- walking in a straight line only one person is hit by the mine hypothetically
- avoid ambushes
- signalling structures
- take the path of MOST resistance, if they dont think anyone would go that way why would they put mines there?
- Mark the mines on a map or gps
	- ask commander if theres mines in an area before heading out for patrol etc
- Dispersion: avoid clumping up to avoid mass casualty events
### Aircraft
- stay away from valuable targets
- dispersion
- cammofloge
- stay on ground floor
- dont give up info indirectly like tossing cig butts on patrol now they know you patrol this area
### Tanks/BMPs
- dispersion
- go underground
- crosstrain
