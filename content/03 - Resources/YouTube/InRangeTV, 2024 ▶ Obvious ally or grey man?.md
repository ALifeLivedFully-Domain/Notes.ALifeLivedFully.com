should you look like an obviously safe ally or try to stay under the radar?

>[!tldr]
>- Survival is always the first priority
>- If you have privilege, **use it**
>- You can be a proactive ally, without being an obvious ally

>[!question]
>- can you speak a bit about how to balance being a "grey man" vs being a clear ally when out in the wild? 
>- Does self preservation of public take priority over projecting a commitment to reject oppression? 
>- Are these two concepts fundamentally incompatible?
## Notes
- You bring in less risk to be more vocal
- more privilege allows you to say more thus it is your responsibility to do so
- unfair to ask those at risk to take an even greater risk, in order to fight a fight they shouldn't have to fight in the first place
- adding yet another target on your back is a hard ask
- Survival always comes first
- depends on what you're doing and where you are
	- sometimes you need to be proactively provocative
- don't need to be an obvious ally in order to be an ally
- you can still be a proactive ally without being an obvious ally
- if you're not surviving, you're not here for the fight tomorrow
- if you have privlige, use it!
