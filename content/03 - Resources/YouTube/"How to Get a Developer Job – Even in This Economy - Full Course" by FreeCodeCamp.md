## Chapters
1. 

## Job search stratagies
- Learn first then keep learning while applying

## Portfolio projects
i keep working on projects but not uploading them to github or not pushing the changes.

Some projects i liked working on that i could polish up:
- Remotion - programatic video editing with react
- My cozy game - I payed for the game assets and started building but still havent created a github repo
- Auto-TerraFirmaCraft metal Alloying calculator
- More Command line utilities!
- Moneyshots
- Nifty Miners 
- Furry community/art store
- websites i built for friends & clients
	- Lara Angelique artist gallery site
	- Spark-y cultural cookbook
	- Uptown micros
- Build a library
- build an API

**Make S.M.A.R.T goals!!!**
i do have a tendency to have large hard to define goals like "learn to program in C"

| Specific | Measurable | Achievable | Relevant | Time bound |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
|          |            |            |          |            |

My project readme's are usually totally shit. 
They argue a great readme should contain these sections:
- Title
	- *Do* have a fun name that is user friendly and sounds like a real app name
	- *Don't* undermine the scale or quality of your project
	- **Bad:** testing-zipping-cmd-app
	- **Good:** Zippy
- Description
	- **Don't** treat it like its not important.
- "Why" (motivation/goal/problem to solve)
	- it should be something meaningful to you a problem you wanted to solve.
- Quick start
	- making your quick start guide is extremely important, you convinced them to try to start, help them succeed at starting!
- Usage
	- available flags
	- example usage
		- Highlight impressive features
- Contributing
	- perhaps someone can improve your app, make it easy for them to do so
	- quick start and usage sections are focused towards users of your applications. this is aimed towards contributors

When i make those crappy remakes of projects that everyone has already made like a todo list dont just make a todo app, **build some life into each project** with a fun name, maybe a neat icon, unique feature(s), etc. **Do-Not downplay your efforts** by using terms like just a test. give each project the respect of being treated as a "real" project.


## Github profile
my profile is pretty strong but i should update it as well as my activity on github

- [ ] Update Profile readme
- [ ] Add project repos


## LinkedIn
my linkedin is always so outdated and im always too lazy to fix it. i should like... do that.


## Resume building
i dont even know where my resume is... 


## Applying
even if i dont think im interested in a new job currently i should keep applying to new ones, never know what you might find.


## Networking
i really wanted to setup a CMS to help me remember to maintain the connections i make.


## Interviewing
I usually do pretty good in interviews but technical interviews sound kinda nerve-wracking


## Relocation
in theory at least i dont mind moving for a job but it would need to be to a good
