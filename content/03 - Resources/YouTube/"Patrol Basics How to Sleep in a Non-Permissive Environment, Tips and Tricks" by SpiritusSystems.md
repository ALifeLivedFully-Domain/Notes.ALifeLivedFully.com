## Notes
- 4 hours per 24 hour period is not enough sleep, you WILL fall asleep even while walking.
- 8-9 hours is the new standard (Ideally)
- woovee? seems like a very lightweight blanket
- sleeping pad, not just for the padding but for insulation!
- woovee + Poncho 
- a bug net is actually a great idea
- secure your equipment agains emergencies, wind, etc.

### Site selection
- look for somewhere with cover & concealment
- look into a **Ranger Grave** 
	- dig out a small trench to sleep in
- make your position known to the guard/others

### Dress in layers
Dressing in layers makes it easier to sleep in your gear. don't forget wet weather gear, to avoid hypothermia.

Layers:
1. Field top
2. Smock
3. Wet weather gear (Full zip)
4. Poncho (Always good to bring) 
5. Level 7 Parka
6. Hat & Gloves

### Hot-swapping sleep equipment
setup your sleep area with double the equipment and trade off sleep and patrol positions.
